# Early Inspiration: Rust for Daebug

## Vision

A Rust-based server could provide the solid foundation that Daebug needs: a single, reliable binary that orchestrates file-based REPL sessions without introducing the complexity of executing code in multiple languages. The vision is simple: **Rust handles the orchestration, host runtimes handle execution**.

## The Core Idea

Imagine a server that:
- Manages file-based REPL sessions with atomic, corruption-free writes
- Coordinates job dispatch and result collection across multiple browser tabs, workers, and remote realms
- Never crashes from memory issues or race conditions
- Deploys as a single binary with no runtime dependencies

This is what Rust could bring to Daebug.

## Why Rust Feels Right

**Reliability.** The file-based REPL depends on careful file management. A server crash during a write could corrupt session logs. Rust's memory safety and explicit error handling make crashes rare.

**Performance.** Supporting dozens of simultaneous browser sessions, each with its own polling loop and background event stream, requires efficient concurrency. Rust's async ecosystem (tokio, async-std) handles this naturally.

**Simplicity.** One binary. No Node version conflicts, no dependency drift. Just compile and run.

**Safety at the boundaries.** The server sits between user agents, browser shims, and the file system. It must validate inputs, prevent path traversal, and handle malformed requests gracefully. Rust's type system and pattern matching make defensive programming natural.

## What Rust Would Handle

The server would be responsible for:

**File orchestration.** Managing the master registry (`daebug.md`) and per-instance log files. Reading appended requests, validating them, and writing results back atomically. No corruption, no race conditions.

**Job coordination.** Tracking which code needs to run in which browser tab or worker. Maintaining job state (requested → dispatched → executing → finished). Handling timeouts and failures.

**HTTP endpoints.** Exposing a simple API that browser shims and agents use to poll for jobs, post results, register workers, and send heartbeats.

**Background event capture.** Buffering console logs, errors, and unhandled rejections until they can be written to the appropriate log file.

## What Rust Would NOT Handle

**Code execution.** The server never runs JavaScript, Python, or any other REPL code. That happens in the browser (for JS), in the Python interpreter (for Python), or in the Debug Adapter Protocol client (for compiled languages). The server just coordinates.

This separation keeps the architecture clean and the server simple.

## The Path Forward

This document captures the early vision. A Rust server for Daebug would:
- Be rock-solid and simple to deploy
- Handle concurrency gracefully
- Never corrupt session logs
- Stay out of the way of code execution

If this direction makes sense, the next step would be prototyping: a minimal Rust HTTP server that can accept a job request, store it in a file, and serve it back to a polling client. From there, build up the full file-based REPL workflow.
